    Big math:
    \math(math-list [
      math-sub (math-paren (math-frac (math-paren (math-list [math-frac math-A math-B; math-plus; math-C]))
        (math-sup math-D (math-paren (math-list [math-n; math-minus; math-1]))))) math-2
    ]);,
    layered:
    \math(math-list [
      math-paren (math-list [math-paren (math-list [math-paren math-A; math-plus; math-B]); math-plus; math-C]);
    ]);,
    radical:
    \math(math-list [
      math-2;
      math-sqrt math-3;
      math-plus;
      math-frac math-2 (math-sqrt math-5);
      math-plus;
      math-frac math-1 (math-sqrt (math-list [math-sup math-x math-2; math-plus; math-1]));

    the solution of the equation
    \math(math-list [
      math-a; math-sup math-x math-2; math-plus; math-b; math-x; math-plus; math-c; math-equal; math-0;
    ]); as to \math(math-x); is
    \math(
      let math-det = math-list [math-sup math-b math-2; math-minus; math-4; math-a; math-c] in
      math-list [
        math-x;
        math-equal;
        math-frac (math-list [math-minus; math-b; math-pm; math-sqrt math-det]) (math-list [math-2; math-a]);
      ]
    );.
    Layered radical:
    \math(math-sqrt (math-sqrt (math-sqrt (math-sqrt math-2))));,
    limits:
    \math(math-list [
      math-lim (math-list [math-n; math-to; math-infty]);

      math-equal;

    fraction superscript:
    \math(math-sup math-e (math-frac math-x math-2));,
    sub-superscript:
    \math(math-list [math-sup (math-sub math-a (math-list [math-n; math-minus; math-1])) math-2; math-b]);,
    sub-superscript correction:
